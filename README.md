Data Collection: collect data sets with features such as age, sex, if the person has hypertension, heart disease, married single or divorced,  average glucose level, BMI, Work Type, Residence type, etc. Has the individual ever smoked and has he or she had stoke before? All these should be included in your datasets.

Data Preprocessing: This stage involves handling missing values; encoding categorical variables; scaling numerical attributes among others also dealing with imbalanced class distribution in cases where there are few cases of strokes compared non-stroke instances may require special attention during analysis phase.

Feature Selection/Engineering: Features selected for training models must be those which have significant contribution towards predicting whether someone is likely going to have a stroke or not. The most common methods used here include correlation analysis; importance scores from tree based models like decision trees/random forests; dimensionality   reduction techniques such as PCA and LDA etc.

Model Selection: Different types of algorithms can make predictions based on input variables. However some may work better than others depending on nature the model and intended use case Logistic regression works well when you have many independent continuous predictors with multicollinearity problems while decision trees are more suitable for categorical data sets containing several objects but few attributes.

Model Training: Involves fitting parameters into our chosen method using the training set thus tuning hyperparameters through cross validation should not be skipped before assessing performance against validation subset(s)

Evaluation: Performance should be measured using appropriate metrics like accuracy; precision; recall ;F1-score & ROC-AUC score which give an overview about how good/bad different types false negative/positive errors might affect final results especially where lives are at stake as it happens in medical field situated around stroke prediction.

Deployment and Monitoring: Deploy the trained model into a production environment where it can predict on new unseen data. You may have to keep updating this model continuously so that its performance remains best always
